# Flight Simulator Software, Developed in C++
as a continuation to the AER4420 Course in my Final year of aerospace engineering atCcairo University>
during the course i was tasked to create an autopilot system for the Lockheed Martin's C5A Aircraft using Matlab/Simulink, this is C++ implementation for the same linearized aircraft dynamics around a certain flight condition with the same controllers.

## Build From Source 
*Dependencies:*
- [XLSX I/O C library](https://github.com/brechtsanders/xlsxio).
- C++ Eigen, most likely preinstalled in your distro, can be downloaded and put in the project directory, but you'll have to do some manual renaming in the header files.

### **Linux Guide:** 
[Download Latest Release](https://github.com/alyayman921/Cpp-Flight-Simulator/releases/download/v-1.0/Release.zip)
Clone This directory & cd inside of it
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alyayman921/Cpp-Flight-Simulator.git && cd Cpp-Flight-Simulator
```
**Install Eigen**
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install libeigen3-dev # or install via your distro's package manager
```

**Clone and make Dependancies**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/brechtsanders/xlsxio.git && cd xlsx*
```

```bash 
# From Inside xlsxio folder
cmake -G"Unix Makefiles" .
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig 
cd ../
```

**Compiling**
```bash
# Back in the Main folder
g++ flightsim.cpp -o FlightSimulator -I/usr/include/eigen3 -lm -lxlsxio_read
```

The release binaries are compiled with gcc-9 to ensure compatibility, since my arch uses gcc16.1, on Ubuntu you'd have to wait 2 years or so to catch up with this version of c++ libraries

```bash
g++-9 -std=c++17 flightsim.cpp -o FlightSimulator -I/usr/include/eigen3  -Wl,-Bstatic -lxlsxio_read -Wl,-Bdynamic -lexpat -lminizip -lz -lm
```

**Run with --help and get started**
```bash
./FlightSimulator --help
```

## About This Simulator
> [!WARNING]
> this model does not approximate the continous time system like matlab would, notice the dynamics change with different time steps.

#### **Small 1ms Timesteps C++ vs Matlab**

#### **Bigger  10ms Timesteps C++ vs Matlab**

## Controller Implementation Time Scheme
- This is a pseudo-Continuous Time project, using same controllers from the S domain like this:
if a state is to be derived (multiplied by s), for the fisrt time step we set the state_derivative = sum of non derivated states, next time step you get the state by doing state += state_derivative * dt, look at the [tf.hpp](tf.hpp) file for more info.

## TODO 
- [x] Make a Generalized Transfer Function class.
- [ ] Deploy controllers to an stm32 based embedded board.
- [ ] Fix The Bug With Altitude Controller for large Values
- [ ] Attach a rendering GUI for the Simulator.
- [ ] Makefile, maybe publish to AUR?

## AI DISCLAIMER
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ai was used in this project to do the logging and the handling of files, it was also used in developing the rk4 solver and linking it to the Rigid Body Dynamics equations.
> this is a learning project, i'm trying to enhance my C++ skills so there's no point of prompting the ai to do it for me.
